webcamToYarp:

webcamToYarp takes only one argument which is the name of the port that will output the image data. It captures an image
from the webcam, converts it into a yarp image and sends it as a PixelRGB yarp image over the specified port
e.g ./webcamToYarp /webcamOut

faceTracking:

faceTracking takes an input image coming into its input port /inputPort and identifies the presence of all faces within the image
then outputs the coordinates for each face over its coordinate port /coordinatePort and also outputs an image with all the faces 
resized to a 200x200 resolution and concatenated horizontally with each other over the output image port /outputImagePort. It also
takes arguments as to on what hardware the computation will take place either 'GPU' or 'CPU' without the ' and the final argument
specifies wether the incoming image is an rgb image or a bayer image. For an rgb image leave the 5th argument empty like so:

./faceTrack /inputPort /coordinatePort /outputImagePort GPU

otherwise to specify a Bayer image input:

./faceTrack /inputPort /coordinatePort /outputImagePort GPU Bayer

Note: So far the code only works reliably on the GPU so always include GPU in the argument list. 
Furthermore ports can be given any name, the ones provided are as an example
