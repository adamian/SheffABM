1) Make a directory "old" and move old stuff in there.
2) The files we use are: 
- SAMpy.py: The main SAM module which is calling ABM.py. This is the middleware between ABM and drivers.
- ABM.py: The core functionality of the ABM
- SAMpy_example_segfaces.py: The up to date demo with face tracking using SAM.

3) Make a class Driver and better structure the drivers to inherit from it.
The train module should be the same for all drivers implementing Driver.

4) Rename SAMpy to FaceDriver, inheriting from Driver.py
Remove calls that the parent class is doing and in the end call the init of the parent with super()
