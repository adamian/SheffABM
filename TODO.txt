1) Make a directory "old" and move old stuff in there.
2) The files we use are: 
- SAMpy.py: The main SAM module which is calling ABM.py. This is the middleware between ABM and drivers.
- ABM.py: The core functionality of the ABM
- SAMpy_example_segfaces.py: The up to date demo with face tracking using SAM.

3) Make a class Driver and better structure the drivers to inherit from it.

4) Rename SAMpy to FaceDriver, inheriting from Driver.py
